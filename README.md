# ΠΛΤΤ Sessions

This events blog style, for the Full Stack Project from Code Institute, consists in showing and allowing the users to see different events produced by ΠΛΤΤ at Rex Malmo Bar. Each event is shown in the principal page with a flyer. This flyer shows the location, different DJs that will play in future events or already played, dates and times. The user is able to click and see different media and information from each event, including: photos, videos, guest dj, bibliography, social media and an embedded Soundcloud set with the music played in the event. Also the user is able to register and login in the site, this will allow them to like and comment on each event. Finally the user will be able to update personal comments or delete them.

[Here is the live version of my project](https://subtevents.herokuapp.com/)

- The Comment model is connected with the post attribute as a foreign key to the Model Post, so there is a direct relation for each session to have exclusive comments, if the session is deleted, also the comments from that session will be deleted. The new model for resubmission consists in a Contact model for Contact form that will allow any user, no need of being logged in, to contact the admin, with name, subject, email, and body text as requirement. This form will be submitted to the back end.


## Features Left to Implement

- Allow the user to change the password.
- Allow the user to recover the password.
- (Solved) Updated comment message "waiting to be approved".


### Bugs

- (Solved) If a Logged-in User comments a session and after that the Admin approves the comment, then the user refreshes the page, the message "comment waiting for approval" will still be there instead of the possibility to create a new comment. For this the user needs to go home and then back to the event page to be able to comment again.

- After final deployment, css was not being shown. First problem was that "X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN'" was writen with "``" instead. Second problem was that in base.html "<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=" {% static 'css/style.css' %} ">" was written like <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=" {% static '/css/style.css' %} "> instead. Bug Fixed.


## Deployment

- The site was deployed to heroku.com using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku. For this it is needed to install Django and supporting libraries, create a new blank Django project and app, set the project to use cloudinary and PostgreSQL and deploy to heroku.

1. In the Git terminal: 'pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn'
2. 'pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2' command for database and connection of PostgreSQL
3. 'pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage' command for installing cloudinary for keeping photos online.
4. 'pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt' command needed for deployment in heroku.
5. 'django-admin startproject subtevents .' command to create a new django project with its name.
6. 'python4 manage.py startapp events' for command creating the app.
7. In subtevents, in settings.py, in installed apps add 'events'.
8. 'python3 manage.py migrate' command for migrating changes and adding them to the database.
9. Deploying in heroku, create a new app.
10. In resources search for postgres to add a database.
11. In settings reveal config vars.
12. Copy string from DATABASE_URL
13. In git at the same level as manage.py create env.py.
14. In env.py we store secret environment variables.
15. env.py should be inside .gitignore
16. in env.py import os and create "os.environ["DATABASE_URL] = string from DATABASE_URL"
17. Add secret key "os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = Secret key"
18. In heroku config vars add SECRET_KEY.
19. Reference env.py in settings.py
20. In settings.py change SECRET_KEY to "SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')"
21. In settings.py add new section "DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))}" 
22. run "python3 manage.py migrate" Now the database is connected to heroku.
23. For cloudinary set up Cloudinary Visit the Cloudinary website.
24. Click on the Sign Up For Free button
25. Provide your name, email address and choose a password
26. For Primary interest, you can choose Programmable Media for image and video API
27. Optional: edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable
28. Click Create Account
29. Verify your email and you will be brought to the dashboard.
30. In cloudinary dashboard copy environment variable without "CLOUDINARY_URL=.
31. In env.py add 'os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "environment variable"'.
32. Add same variable in heroku.
33. Add in heroku config vars "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1" (removed at final deployment) for correct deployment.
34. In settings.py in installed apps we add cloudinary. First one in the top of django staticfiles and the other one in the bottom:
 
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary',
    'events',
]

35. Connect django with cloudinary as follow:

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
 
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'

DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'

36. We need to tell django where our templates will be store, in settings.py under BASE_DIR:
 
TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
 
37. we change DIRS in TEMPLATES in settings.py:

'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],

38. ADD heroku host name into allowed hosts in settings.py:
 
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['subtevents.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']

39. Create 3 directories in the top level. Media, Static and Templates.
40. Create procfile "web: gunicorn subtevents.wsgi".
41. Git add ., git commit, git push.
42. In heroku dashboard, in the deploy tab, click on github, search the correct project repository, connect with it and finally deploy the branch.
43. Work on the project.
44. For final deployment in settings.py "DEBUG = False" and "X_FRAME_OPTIONS = ‘SAMEORIGIN’".
45. Erase DISABLE_COLLECSTATIC in heroku config vars.
46. In heroku deploy tab, manual deploy, deploy branch.
